### 🥈 Second place solution for the DSN Free AI Classes in Every City 2025 Hackathon

This notebook was developed on Google Colab to build a regression-based solution aimed at providing insights into which products yield higher returns at **Impact Stores**, a Nigerian retail chain with over 1,500 products. The insights are intended to guide strategic expansion decisions.

### Core Objective
The core objective was to predict **item store returns** using machine learning regression models. After extensive model experimentation and cross-validation on various algorithms—including Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Decision Trees, and Linear Regression—I found **Lasso Regression** with an alpha value of **60.5** to yield the best performance based on **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

#### Key Contributions:

* **Feature Engineering**:
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed that **Item Price** played a critical role in predicting returns. To enrich the feature space, I created transformed versions of the price feature using **logarithmic, square root, reciprocal**, and **cube root** functions. I also utilised Polynomial Features to capture non-linearity and the Standard Scalar function to normalise input features. These transformations contributed to improved model accuracy.

* **Categorical Encoding**:
  I applied **one-hot encoding** to categorical variables(Item_Type, Store_Type, Store_Location_Type, Store_Start_Year), which further boosted performance by allowing the model to interpret non-numeric data effectively.

* **Model Evaluation**:
  Performance was assessed using **RMSE** on both the training and test sets to ensure the model generalizes well. Lasso Regression consistently outperformed other models in cross-validation, making it the final choice.
